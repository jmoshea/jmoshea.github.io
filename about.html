    <h2 class="h2">Brian</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <span class="wireframe-image"><img src="images/brian-macro.png"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-left">Both the macro and micro summaries above are achievable using Plotly’s graph design tools: choropleth map and time series/line chart. With understandability, the macrosummary does convey the important information of how many vaccines are administered in each state; however, by using total number of vaccines instead of per capita, it may be misleading because the shade of color for each state will be dependent on the population of each state. Through the perspective of comfort, the macrosummary functions well because it displays all the information through a diagram that is visually appealing and accessible. In the lens of political intent, the macrosummary may appear biased because of the use of the color blue, which is typically associated with the Democratic Party. The macrosummary achieves the privacy perspective because it doesn’t expose any individual data and it does not request any additional data from the user. The microsummary design is effective in its iterability because it can be applied to each state. Yet, it may be misconstrued in the lens of perceptibility depending on the scale used in the graph. The microsummary may also be inaccessible to blind people because it is dependent on visual perception to read.

    <h2 class="h2">Juliet</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <span class="wireframe-image"><img src="images/juliet-macro.png"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <span class="wireframe-image"><img src="images/juliet-micro.png"></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-left">The macrosummary above (Juliet’s) and the macrosummary at the very top (Brian’s) are very similar. The only difference is that Juliet’s macrosummary measures the fully vaccinated data per hundred instead of just the total number of vaccinations. This may be more helpful through the lens of understandability because it accounts for different population sizes in different states. Regarding the microsummary, through the lens of iterability, it may be difficult to achieve because it may not be possible to achieve diagrams of different states to correct proportions and to fill the diagrams with the correct color through iteration. Through accessibility+equity, the microsummary also may be difficult for those with poor motor skills because it is dependent on the usage of a scroll bar. The microsummary has effective feedback because when you scroll the scroll bar, color shifts will reflect different data and will signify to the user changes in time.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Ben</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <span class="wireframe-image"><img src="images/ben-macro.png"></span>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <span class="wireframe-image"><img src="images/ben-micro.png"></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-left">I chose to use the Plotly map template for this lo-fi sketch. In my micro summary sketch, the user sees the United States; each state is color coded based on a key to the percent of that state's vaccinated population. The user gets a quick glance at the vaccination rate of each state. My macro summary sketch, shows the percent of vaccinated individuals in that state as a function of time. I would present this in a line graph. These sketches are very achievable. I would need data sets that include vaccination rates over a period of time. My sketches are meant to be very understandable, giving the user quick information without extraneous detail. If the user wants to learn more about a certain state, all they would have to do is click it. Regarding discoverability, whenever a user clicks on a state, that state would outline in red. I will have to include instructions to indicate the user that they can click on the states. Regarding accessibility, I worry that using different shades of a single color could affect certain color-blind individuals. I believe that our color choice is important for political intent. Red and blue relate to political parties, therefore we should use a more neutral color.
